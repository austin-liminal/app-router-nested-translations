This repo provides an example of how to pass data to nested RSCs while avoiding prop-drilling, or sending all of the data to the client.

## The Problem

In NextJS' [localization guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization#localization), they suggest the following setup:

- Move your `<root>/layout.tsx` to `<root>/[lang]/layout.tsx` 
- Create `dictionaries/[lang].json` files for each supported language
- Import the dictionary as a module into layouts or pages

The end result looks something like this:

```tsx
import { getDictionary } from './dictionaries'
 
export default async function Page({ params: { lang } }) {
  const dict = await getDictionary(lang) // en
  return <button>{dict.products.cart}</button> // Add to Cart
}
```

This is great for an introductory example! But what if we have nested server components? ðŸ¤”

In this case, let's say this is a Product Details Page with an image carousel, and product details panel where the add to cart button is contained:


- Image Carousel has "Previous" and "Next" buttons that we need localization for
- Product details contains headings for "Description", and the "Add to Cart" button text

Being good React citizens, we don't want all this code in the page! So let's try and break it up:

```tsx
export const ProductImageCarousel = ({ previousText, nextText }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button>{previousText}</button>
      {/* rest of carousel */}
      <button>{nextText}</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export const AddToCartButton = ({ text }) => {
  return (
    <button>{text}</button>
  )
}

export const ProductDesription = ({ descriptionText, addToCartButtonText }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{descriptionText}</h2>
      <AddToCartButton text={addToCartButtonText} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

now, let's update our previous page example:

```tsx
import { getDictionary } from './dictionaries'
 
export default async function Page({ params: { lang } }) {
  const dict = await getDictionary(lang) // en
  return (
    <div>
      <ProductImageCarousel 
        previousText={dict['prev']} 
        nextText={dict['next']} />
      <ProductDescription 
        addToCartButtonText={dict['addToCart']} 
        descriptionText={dict['description']} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

This is starting to look more like the prop-drilling we've been trying to avoid in React for years! Are we going backwards??

It might be tempting to consider adding `dict` to a React Context, which can be shared throughout the React hierarchy. But doing so adds the data on the client _and_ server. For an app with dozens or hundreds of translations, that's data we don't want to ship to the browser, as it never changes once rendered.

So what do we do?

## Solution

In this repo, we make a compromise: use Context, but store a _reference_ to data in the context.

What does that mean concretely though?

In the translations example, we said we don't want to ship all the translations to the client. But would be it ok to ship, say, the current language to the client?

```tsx
  // Parse the language from the URL path in a server component
  const language = parseLanguage(params.locale);

  return (
    <html lang={language}>
      <body>
        {/* store the language string in the context */}
        <TranslationsProvider language={language}>
          {children}
        </TranslationsProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
```

If we could do that, then we can reference the context from a client component "wrapper". Since client components can render server components, we can then pass the language into a server component in another file:

`src/components/translation/index.tsx`

```tsx
export const Translation: FC<TranslationProps> = ({ t }) => {
  const { language } = useContext(TranslationsContext);

  return <ServerTranslation language={language} t={t} />;
};
```

`src/components/translation/server.tsx`

```tsx
export const ServerTranslation: FC<ServerTranslationProps> = ({
  language,
  t,
}) => {
  const value = translations[language][t];
  return <>{value}</>;
};
```

## Running the example

1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`
1. go to http://localhost:3000/en or `/it` or `/es`

You should see the translated values in the HTML, but you should NOT see them more than once in the HTML, and not in the serialized props sent down for rehydration.
